# Yahoo Finance Data Scraper

This Spring Boot project scrapes historical finance data from Yahoo Finance and stores it in an in-memory database (H2). The application includes a scheduled task to periodically scrape and update the forex data.

## About the Project

- **src/main/java**: Contains the Java source code for the application.
- **src/main/resources**: Contains application configuration files.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file containing project dependencies and plugins.

## Maven Dependencies

- **Spring Boot**: Framework to build the application.
- **Jsoup**: Library to scrape and parse HTML.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for storing scraped data.
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, etc.
- **Spring JPA**: Provides JPA-based data access layers.
- **Spring Boot DevTools**: Provides development-time features for a smoother development experience.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Post Forex Data

**Endpoint:** `POST localhost:8080/api/forex-data`

**Description:** This endpoint is used to trigger the scraping of forex data for specific currency pairs and time period. It can be accessed via any HTTP POST request tool.

**Request Parameters:**
- `from` (String): The currency code from which the exchange rate is to be fetched (e.g. "USD").
- `to` (String): The currency code to which the exchange rate is to be fetched (e.g. "INR").
- `period` (String): The period for the historical data to be fetched (e.g. "1W", "1M", "3M", "6M", "1Y"}.

### 2. Fetch All Data

**Endpoint:** `GET localhost:8080/api/fetch-all-data`

**Description:** This endpoint retrieves all the data stored in the database. It can be accessed via a web browser or any HTTP GET request tool.

## Accessing the H2 Database Console

To access the H2 database console, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Spring Boot application.**
   - Make sure the application is running.

2. **Open your browser.**

3. **Navigate to the H2 console:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`

4. **Login to the H2 console:**
   - **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:forexdata`
   - **Username:** `sa`
   - **Password:** *(leave this field empty)*

5. **Click on the "Connect" button.**

Now you can interact with the in-memory database directly from the H2 console.
